# Discoshell

Discoshell, or Discord Shell, is a shell that operates as a Discord bot. It can access
files on the server that the bot is running on, as well as navigate through the file
structure. 

## Usage
This bot functions as a psuedo SSH and SFTP. It can upload files from the host to the
Discord server that it is running on. As well as download files from Discord's own
file server that have been attached to messages. However this is limited by the
maximum file size for message attachements.
